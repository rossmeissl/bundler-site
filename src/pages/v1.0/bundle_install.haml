      Make sure all dependencies in your Gemfile are
      available to your application.

      $ bundle install
    .notes
      Gems will be installed to your default system location for gems. If your
      system gems are stored in a root-owned location (such as in Mac OSX),
      bundle will ask for your root password to install them there.

      Install your dependencies, even gems that are already installed
      to your system gems, to a location other than your system's gem
      repository. In this case, install them to <code>vendor/bundle</code>.

        $ bundle install vendor/bundle

      .notes
        Further <code>bundle</code> commands or calls to <code>Bundler.setup</code> or
        <code>Bundler.require</code> will remember this location.

      Install all dependencies using defaults appropriate for deployment.
    :highlight_plain
      $ bundle install --deployment
    .notes
      %p
        The <code>--deployment</code> flag activates a number of deployment-friendly
        conventions:

      %ul
        %li Isolate all gems into <code>vendor/bundle</code>
        %li Require an up-to-date <code>Gemfile.lock</code>
        %li
          If <code>bundle package</code> was run, do not fetch gems
          from rubygems.org. Instead, only use gems in the checked
          in <code>vendor/cache</code>
